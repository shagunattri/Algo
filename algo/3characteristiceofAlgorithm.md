### Characteristics of Algorithm

- Input
Can take one or more inputs
- Output
Can be imagined as fns that give result of some type where atleast one output should be generated by the algorithm.
- Definiteness
Every stmt should be ambigious and stmnts should be definiteness and have meaning.

Performing known steps

Eg: iota can not be used
- Finiteness
Algo should have a finite no of stmts and should stop after execution of steps.
- Effectiveness
Not write unnecessary steps and serve purpose also have procedure to make it effective.
